# Cybersecurity Learning Lab
_A personal study repository by FedeContri_

## What This Is

This is my personal notebook for exploring cybersecurity concepts through hands-on experiments.  
It's where I take textbook theory and see how it works in practice — always within strictly controlled environments.

---

## The Philosophy

> I believe the best way to understand defense is to study offense in a safe, isolated setting.

Every file here represents hours of research, testing, and learning.

## The Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Where experiments run

- **Isolated virtual machines** (usually VirtualBox)  
- **Lab-only network ranges** (`192.168.x.x`)  
- **Zero internet access** from test environments  

### The legal line I don't cross

**This is education, not action.**  
Testing on real systems isn't just unethical — it's illegal under multiple laws  
(Italian art. 615-quinquies CP, EU NIS2, etc.).

**Everything stays in the sandbox.**

---

## What I'm Learning

**Network security fundamentals**  
How traffic flows, where it can be intercepted, and how to protect it

**Vulnerability analysis**  
Understanding weaknesses to build stronger systems

**Ethical methodology**  
How to research security without crossing ethical or legal boundaries

---

## How I Work (AI & Me)

I use AI as a **study partner**, not a shortcut.

It helps with:
- Explaining complex technical concepts in simpler terms  
- Suggesting experiment structures  
- Reviewing my approach for safety and ethics  

**The understanding, decisions, and responsibility are mine alone.**

## About the Files

### Denial of Service Theorical Test

Study of older DoS techniques, focused on ARP protocol weaknesses.  
More historical analysis than practical tool.

**Purpose:** understanding how attacks worked to recognize modern variants  
**Scope:** VirtualBox internal networks only

---

### Debian ISO bash script modified with cubic

Experiment to understand Windows authentication by examining the SAM registry in a controlled VM.

- AI-assisted in the initial drafting  
- Modified through my own research  
- Never run on a real system  
- Operation not guaranteed  

**Important note:**  
This exists to understand how authentication works, not to bypass it on systems I don't own.

---

## License & Reality Check

- MIT License for the code  
- No warranty  
- Not responsible for misuse  

This isn't a toolkit.  
It's a learning journal.

If you're looking for real security tools, there are better-maintained, professional projects.  
If you're learning like I am, welcome — but learn responsibly.
